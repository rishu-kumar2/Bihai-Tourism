            available in Bihar, including Lai from Gaya. The main component of this Lai is Ram dana seeds. These ram

            <h3>Thekua</h3>
            Thekua is a traditional deep-fried sweet snack from Bihar made from whole wheat flour (atta). Thekua is also
            called kajuria, khajoor, and many more names. <br>
            The key thekua ingredients are whole wheat flour (atta), ghee, and jaggery (gur or unrefined brown sugar).
            it is traditionally made with jaggery, which makes it healthy and tasty. You can replace jaggery with
            regular
            sugar or honey if you want. When melting jaggery, grate it and use a very small amount of water. This is
            important to achieve a stiff dough, which is essential for the preparation of the right consistency,
            thickness,
            and texture. Coconut, fennel seed, and cardamom are also added to the thekua recipe to enhance the taste,
            flavor, and aroma of thekua. Thekua is traditionally rolled out, shaped, and pressed against a wooden mold
            called saancha, which can be greased with ghee to prevent the dough from sticking to it before it is
            deep-fried.
            <br>
            This traditional Bihari thekua recipe is offered as prasad during the Bihari festival of Chhath Puja (it is
            considered one of the Chhath Puja special recipes).

            <h3>Tilkut </h3>
            In addition to having great landmarks and unmatched culture, Bihar has a plethora of delicacies to offer.
            Tilkut
            is one such delicacy that is relished by all and holds a special significance in Bihari cuisine. <br>
            Tilkut is a sweet savory made in the Indian states of Bihar and Jharkhand. This is made of pounded â€™tilaâ€™ or
            sesame seed and is available only in winters. A thick hard base of sugar the size of a tennis ball is rolled
            in
            copious amounts of sesame seed and then hammered to roll out in a round shape. The more the seed, the
            softer,
            better, and amorphous it is. <br>
            Made of a mix of the lintel, gur (jaggery) in the right proportions and heated at an optimum temperature in
            cold
            but dry weather, skillfully hammered and shaped like biscuits. Normally, three types of tilkuts are
            available â€”
            the refined sugar tilkut is white in color, the shakkar tilkut is made of unrefined sugar and is light brown
            in
            color and the gur tilkut is made of jaggery and is dark brown in color. Each of these varieties has its own
            flavor. <br>
            It is a traditional dessert primarily made during Makar Sankranti, the harvest festival in India.

            using
            grinded rice flour, mixed fennel seeds, and ghee. Mix it all together and crush the jaggery into powdered
            form
            and add it to the mixture. One can use dry fruits to increase the taste. We can sprinkle some milk and
            grease
